                    <p>Which is better for reducing CO2 emissions: carbon tax, or cap and trade systems?<br>In this project I created an agent based model to simulate power companies and their interactions with one another with varying carbon dioxide reduction measures applied.
            This was a really interesting project for me, both in implementing an agent based system from the ground up and also in the surrounding research.
            The system itself is built in Java, with an interface written in python, using python notebooks.
            The paper I wrote on the model is also linked at the side. </p>

                    <p>An expert system built in Java for a practical course during my bachelors degree. The system gives a sentence estimate for someone convicted of robbery under the Swiss legal system.<br>I really enjoyed making this, as it was the first time I made an application of this type and scale. It was also fascinating to discover more about the law, as I was working with a lawyer to ensure accuracy of the project.
            That said, the end result is still very much a prototype and its outputs should be taken with a grain of salt.<br>
            The full documentation and code may be found on the GitHub pages site linked at the side. There's also a download link for if you've been breaking the law in Switzerland, or are just interested. </p>
