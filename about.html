                    I am currently studying a Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. I recently completed my Bachelors, also in AI at the University of Groningen where I also worked as a teaching assistant accross multiple courses 
                    and held the position of Chair within the student delegation of the Programme Committee for the 2020-21 academic year.
                    
                    Within Groningen I was active within the international comedy scene. This was predominantly as a member of the improv group Stranger Things Have Happened.

                <p>You can find me on GitLab, although I have only recently switched to using it so there is currently very little to see. I mostly write in Java, C++ and Python, however I am also exploring other languages such as JavaScript and Rust.</p>
