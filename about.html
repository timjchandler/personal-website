                <p>
                    I enjoy playing around with code, writing programs and learning new languages. Currently I'm to learning Rust, as well as the key web languages. I'm also continuously improving my python, c++ and java. <br>You can see some of my work on github. I intend to try and work on a small project each month in 2022. Let's see how long this intention lasts!

                <h2>computer graphics</h2>
                <p>
                    It's always satisfying to be able to really see the results of what you're working on. Computer graphics is great for that, even when mistakes are made and a previously innocuous model turns into an abomination of colours and triangles.<br>
                    I do a decent amount of messing about in blender, but particularly enjoy working with shaders, both through node editors and direct programming. There are just so many more possibilities for visual monstrosities!

                <h2>games</h2>
                <p>
                    Games are a great opportunity for giving a bit more life to some of the computer graphics projects.<br> So far I haven't made anything that I'm happy enough with to put out into the world, but there are a couple of projects that are nearing that stage. I'll update the website with them once they're done.

                <h2>comedy</h2>
                <p>
                    Before moving to Edinburgh I was part of the comedy group Stranger Things Have Happened. It was a lot of fun, even if the pandemic made live shows more difficult/non-existant.<br>
                    I'm hoping to get back into live comedy again soon. But in any case, Stranger Things Have Happened are still going strong, and well worth checking out.
