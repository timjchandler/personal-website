                        This website! As you can probably tell, it is a work in progress. I'm trying to improve my HTML, CSS and JavaScript through designing and building this site. 
                        <br>Getting to know these tools has been interesting so far. There have been amusing bugs, such as making the entire page spin around rather than just the berries in the background. Good times.

                        This is a calculator allowing you to see how many more days you are allowed to stay within the EEA when travelling from outside. <br>
                        Currently it is only allowed for a person to stay 90 days within a rolling 180 day window. This calculator lets you enter any intended travel and see how much allowance remains.<br>
                        Is this useful for anyone? Maybe. Either way it's a simple project that I'm working on in Rust using web-assembly.

                    This is the main game I'm working on at the moment. It is currently in a very early state, I am still working on level design and mechanics. 
                    <br>For now, the game is being developed in Unity. 
                    <br>Soon I intend to start a development blog.

                        Which is better for reducing CO2 emissions: carbon tax, or cap and trade systems? 
                        <br>In this project I created an agent based model to simulate power companies and their interactions with one another with varying carbon dioxide reduction measures applied.<br>
                        This was a really interesting project for me, both in implementing an agent based system from the ground up and also in the surrounding research.<br>
                        The system itself is built in Java, with an interface written in python, using python notebooks. <br>
                        The paper I wrote on the model is also linked below.

                        An expert system built in Java for a practical course during my bachelors degree. The system gives a sentence estimate for someone convicted of robbery under the Swiss legal system.<br>
                        I really enjoyed making this, as it was the first time I made an application of this type and scale. It was also fascinating to discover more about the law, as I was working with a lawyer to ensure
                        accuracy of the project.<br>
                        That said, the end result is still very much a prototype and its outputs should be taken with a grain of salt.<br>
                        The full documentation and code may be found on the GitHub pages site linked below. There's also a download link for if you've been breaking the law in Switzerland, or are just interested.
